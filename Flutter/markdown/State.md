State in Flutter refers to any data or information that can change during the lifecycle of a widget and affects how the widget is displayed. State determines the behavior and appearance of a widget at any given time and can change dynamically in response to user actions, API calls, or other events.

Flutter widgets can be:

    Stateless: Widgets with no state, meaning they remain static and do not update after being built.
    Stateful: Widgets that maintain state, allowing them to dynamically rebuild and update their UI when the state changes.

State in Flutter is managed using StatefulWidget for local state or external state management tools for global or shared state.
