Here are three C++ projects that are challenging and rewarding, helping you learn fundamental C++ concepts and potentially applying them to real-world scenarios:

1. Chat Server with ZeroMQ and Multithreading

Overview: Build a chat server where multiple clients can connect and exchange messages.

Learning Goals:

Implement multithreading to handle multiple client connections.

Use ZeroMQ for message-passing between clients and the server.

Handle message queuing, client identification, and message broadcasting.

Add error handling and message logging for robustness.


Challenges: Dealing with asynchronous communication, ensuring thread safety, and managing client disconnects gracefully.


2. Trading Algorithm Simulation Platform

Overview: Build a platform where users can test simple trading algorithms on simulated market data.

Learning Goals:

Work with data structures to store and process historical and real-time market data.

Implement strategies like moving averages, momentum, and mean reversion.

Serialize data using formats like JSON or Protobuf and store simulation results.


Challenges: Handling data efficiently, developing a clean architecture for strategy plugins, and managing different timeframes and market scenarios.


3. File-Based Database with Query Support

Overview: Create a lightweight, file-based database with basic SQL-like query capabilities.

Learning Goals:

Implement a database structure that reads and writes data to files.

Use algorithms and data structures to optimize data retrieval and storage.

Design a parser for simple SQL-like commands (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE).


Challenges: Handling data consistency, optimizing read and write operations, and designing a user-friendly query interface.


These projects cover networking, data management, algorithms, and system designâ€”building blocks for many advanced C++ applications. Would any of these align with your interests?
