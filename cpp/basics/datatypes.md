Data types in C++ and their typical memory usage, organized from fundamental types to specialized library types.

1. Primitive Data Types

Boolean (bool): Represents true or false, typically takes up 1 byte.

Character (char): Used for characters, usually takes up 1 byte.

Wide Character (wchar_t): For larger character sets like Unicode, generally 2 or 4 bytes.

UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 Characters (char8_t, char16_t, char32_t): Used for encoding specific character formats; char8_t uses 1 byte, char16_t uses 2 bytes, and char32_t uses 4 bytes.

Integer Types:

short: 2 bytes, generally used when smaller integer range is sufficient.

int: Typically 4 bytes, the standard integer type.

long: Often 4 bytes on 32-bit systems and 8 bytes on 64-bit systems, offering a larger range.

long long: At least 8 bytes, used for even larger integer values.


Floating-Point Types:

float: Single-precision floating-point number, usually 4 bytes.

double: Double-precision floating-point number, typically 8 bytes.

long double: Extended precision, can vary (often 8, 12, or 16 bytes).



2. Derived Data Types

Void (void): Represents the absence of type; used primarily for functions that do not return a value.

Null Pointer (nullptr_t): A type to denote null pointers, which are often platform-dependent in size (1 byte or up to 4 bytes).

Pointers: Variables that store memory addresses. Their size varies by system architectureâ€”typically 4 bytes on 32-bit systems and 8 bytes on 64-bit systems.

Enumerations (enum): Defined by the compiler, usually occupies the same space as an integer.

Arrays: Sequential collection of elements of the same type, with a size equal to the total of all elements. The size is fixed at compile-time.

Structures and Classes (struct, class): Collections of different types. Their memory size is the sum of member sizes, potentially with extra padding for alignment.

Unions (union): Similar to structs but with all members sharing the same memory space, so the size is determined by the largest member.


3. Type Modifiers

Signed and Unsigned: Modifiers applied to integer types to control value range. For example, signed int can hold both positive and negative values, whereas unsigned int can only hold non-negative values, doubling its positive range.

Short and Long Modifiers: Modify the size and range of integer types. For instance, short int generally uses 2 bytes, while long int could be 4 bytes (or more, depending on the system). These modifiers are also applicable to double (e.g., long double).


4. Fixed-Width Integer Types

These types, introduced in C++11, guarantee specific widths across systems:

int8_t and uint8_t: Signed and unsigned 8-bit integers (1 byte).

int16_t and uint16_t: Signed and unsigned 16-bit integers (2 bytes).

int32_t and uint32_t: Signed and unsigned 32-bit integers (4 bytes).

int64_t and uint64_t: Signed and unsigned 64-bit integers (8 bytes).

Pointer Integer Types (intptr_t, uintptr_t): Special types to store pointer addresses, sizes depend on platform architecture.



5. Standard Library Types (STL Containers)

These are templates that can store various types, providing flexibility at the cost of additional memory overhead.

String (std::string): Dynamically sized string, memory usage varies with the string length.

Vector (std::vector): Dynamic array that can grow in size, with memory proportional to the number of elements plus a small overhead.

List (std::list): Doubly linked list, where each node has a pointer to the next and previous elements.

Map and Unordered Map (std::map, std::unordered_map): Associative containers storing key-value pairs; memory usage depends on the number of elements and the data types used.

Set and Unordered Set (std::set, std::unordered_set): Containers that store unique elements, either in sorted order (set) or in no specific order (unordered set).

Array (std::array): Fixed-size array, defined at compile time.

Pair and Tuple (std::pair, std::tuple): Used to store fixed numbers of heterogeneous elements, memory depends on the data types involved.


These data types cover a broad range of C++ capabilities, from basic variable storage to complex data structures designed for dynamic applications. Their memory usage depends on the specific type and, in some cases, the number of elements they store.
